            Whether you're a beginner just starting out or an experienced
            developer looking for courses to enhance your skills and reach
            higher levels of software engineering, these learning paths will
            help you achieve your goal.

              <h3>Fundamentals</h3>
              <p>
                Essential courses that anyone pursuing a career as a
                professional software engineer should take. Data structures,
                algorithms, design patterns, and more!

              <h2>Programming Languages</h2>
              <p class="path__accordion-content-text">
                I have several courses on various programming languages such as
                Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#. Professional software
                engineers often know more than one language, but if you're
                starting out, just focus on one language.
              </p>
              <p class="path__accordion-content-text">
                I recommend you learn Java first, even if you're not planning to
                use it in the future. Java is a classic programming language
                with amazing features. Once you learn Java, you can quickly and
                easily switch to similar languages like JavaScript, C#, C++,
                etc.

                I have several courses on various programming languages such as
                Python, Java, JavaScript, and C#. Professional software
                engineers often know more than one language, but if you're
                starting out, just focus on one language.
              </p>
              <p class="path__accordion-content-text">
                I recommend you learn Java first, even if you're not planning to
                use it in the future. Java is a classic programming language
                with amazing features. Once you learn Java, you can quickly and
                easily switch to similar languages like JavaScript, C#, C++,
                etc.
